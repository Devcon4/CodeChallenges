# Code Challenge 01 - Create a Blog
---
## Description
This is the first code challenge! ðŸŽ‰ This should be the first of many little challenges. This challenge was to create a website in two weeks (5/29/19 - 6/12/19) with a post describing what tools/architecture you used to build the site. The site had to be hosted and the repo public so others can take a look at them.
